Welcome to the Thames Valley Fungus Group. We are a group of enthusiasts interested in the identification, conservation and recording of fungi in the Thames Valley area serving Berkshire, North Hampshire and South Oxfordshire. We meet for forays during the year, primarily during the Autumn months and in areas of overlap, we hold joint forays with the Hampshire and Oxfordshire groups. Further details can be found on our forays page or else contact us at <thamesvalleyfg@frdbi.org.uk>
